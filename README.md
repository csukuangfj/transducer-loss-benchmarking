# Introduction

This repo tries to benchmark the following implementation of
transducer loss in terms of speed and memory consumption:

- [k2][k2]
- [torchaudio][torchaudio]
- [warp-transducer][warp-transducer]
- [optimized_transducer][optimized_transducer]

[torchaudio]: https://github.com/pytorch/audio
[optimized_transducer]: https://github.com/csukuangfj/optimized_transducer
[warp-transducer]: https://github.com/HawkAaron/warp-transducer
